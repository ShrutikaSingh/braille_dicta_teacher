The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a communication protocol used to transfer data between micro-computers like the Raspberry Pi and peripheral devices. These peripheral devices may be either sensors or actuators.

SPI uses 4 separate connections to communicate with the target device. These connections are the serial clock (CLK), Master Input Slave Output (MISO), Master Output Slave Input (MOSI) and Chip Select (CS).
